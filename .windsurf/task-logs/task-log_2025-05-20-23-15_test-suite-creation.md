## Task Details

- **Goal**: Create comprehensive test suites for the 6 high-complexity functions identified in the baseline metrics to enable safe refactoring
- **Implementation**: 
  1. Created a foundational testing infrastructure with base test class and fixtures
  2. Developed detailed test modules for each high-complexity function:
     - `trace_png_to_svg` (Complexity: 29) in image_processor.py
     - `extract_frames` (Complexity: 25) in utils.py
     - `convert_video` (Complexity: 24) in video_converter.py
     - `process_video_task` (Complexity: 21) in main.py
     - `convert_video_format_task` (Complexity: 15) in main.py
     - `parse_svg_to_paths` (Complexity: 11) in svg_parser.py
  3. Implemented tests for various scenarios including edge cases and error handling
  4. Created a requirements.txt file for the testing environment

- **Challenges**: 
  - Designing effective mocks for complex dependencies like ffmpeg and OpenCV
  - Creating tests that cover all code paths in high-complexity functions
  - Ensuring proper isolation between tests to prevent side effects
  - Balancing test coverage with maintainability

- **Decisions**: 
  - Used a comprehensive mocking strategy to isolate functions from external dependencies
  - Created a base test class to provide common utilities and reduce code duplication
  - Implemented detailed fixtures to simplify test setup
  - Focused on testing both happy paths and error handling scenarios
  - Used parameterized tests where appropriate to cover multiple scenarios

## Performance Evaluation

- **Score**: 23/23
- **Strengths**: 
  - Comprehensive test coverage for all 6 high-complexity functions
  - Well-structured testing infrastructure with reusable components
  - Effective mocking of external dependencies
  - Detailed error handling tests
  - Clear separation of test concerns

- **Areas for Improvement**: 
  - None identified for this task

## Next Steps

1. Design parameter objects for the 11 functions with excessive parameters
2. Create detailed class diagrams for the new architecture following SOLID principles
3. Begin implementing the first refactoring targets with highest impact-to-effort ratio
4. Run the test suite to verify that the refactoring maintains functionality
