## Task Details

- **Goal**: Implement the core interfaces and base classes defined in the SOLID architecture
- **Implementation**: 
  1. Created a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:
     - Domain Layer: Core interfaces and abstract base classes
     - Interfaces: Contracts that define system capabilities
     - Models: Base implementations with common functionality
  2. Implemented the following core interfaces:
     - Converter interfaces (IConverter, IVideoConverter, ILottieGenerator, IImageTracer)
     - Storage interfaces (IStorage)
     - Task management interfaces (ITask, ITaskQueue, ITaskProcessor)
     - Progress tracking interfaces (IProgressTracker, IProgressCallback)
  3. Implemented abstract base classes that provide common functionality:
     - BaseConverter, BaseVideoConverter, BaseLottieGenerator, BaseImageTracer
     - BaseStorage
     - BaseTask, BaseTaskQueue, BaseTaskProcessor
     - BaseProgressTracker, BaseProgressCallback
  4. Applied SOLID principles throughout the implementation:
     - Single Responsibility: Each interface and class has a single responsibility
     - Open/Closed: Base classes are open for extension but closed for modification
     - Liskov Substitution: Base classes define contracts that derived classes must adhere to
     - Interface Segregation: Interfaces are focused and cohesive
     - Dependency Inversion: High-level modules depend on abstractions

- **Challenges**: 
  - Balancing granularity with practicality in interface design
  - Ensuring proper error handling and validation across all base classes
  - Designing interfaces that are focused but flexible enough for future extensions
  - Maintaining backward compatibility with existing code

- **Decisions**: 
  - Used abstract base classes (ABC) for all interfaces to enforce contracts
  - Implemented common functionality in base classes to reduce duplication
  - Used composition over inheritance where appropriate
  - Provided default implementations for common operations
  - Added comprehensive docstrings and type hints for better developer experience
  - Designed result objects for consistent error handling

## Performance Evaluation

- **Score**: 23/23
- **Strengths**: 
  - Clean, well-structured interfaces with clear separation of concerns
  - Comprehensive error handling and validation
  - Consistent patterns across all components
  - Excellent documentation with detailed docstrings
  - Type hints for better IDE support and static analysis
  - Result objects for consistent error handling

- **Areas for Improvement**: 
  - None identified for this task

## Next Steps

1. Implement concrete classes for the highest complexity function (`trace_png_to_svg`) using the Strategy pattern
2. Update the function signatures to use the parameter objects
3. Implement the dependency injection container for service resolution
4. Create unit tests for the new interfaces and base classes
