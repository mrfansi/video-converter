# Task Log: SOLID Architecture Design

## Task Information

- **Date**: 2025-05-20
- **Time Started**: 23:25
- **Time Completed**: 23:35
- **Files Modified**: 
  - Created `/Users/mrfansi/GitHub/video-converter/.windsurf/architecture/solid_architecture.md`
  - Created `/Users/mrfansi/GitHub/video-converter/.windsurf/architecture/high_complexity_refactoring.md`

## Task Details

- **Goal**: Create detailed class diagrams for the new architecture following SOLID principles and design specific refactoring approaches for high-complexity functions
- **Implementation**: 
  1. Designed a comprehensive SOLID architecture with clear separation of concerns:
     - Domain Layer: Core interfaces and models
     - Application Layer: Services that orchestrate domain operations
     - Infrastructure Layer: Concrete implementations of interfaces
     - API Layer: HTTP endpoints and request handling
  2. Created detailed class diagrams for each architectural component using Mermaid syntax
  3. Developed specific refactoring approaches for all 6 high-complexity functions:
     - `trace_png_to_svg` (Complexity: 29)
     - `extract_frames` (Complexity: 25)
     - `convert_video` (Complexity: 24)
     - `process_video_task` (Complexity: 21)
     - `convert_video_format_task` (Complexity: 15)
     - `parse_svg_to_paths` (Complexity: 11)
  4. Applied appropriate design patterns for each function:
     - Strategy Pattern for algorithm selection
     - Factory Pattern for object creation
     - Chain of Responsibility for processing pipelines
     - Template Method for defining workflows

- **Challenges**: 
  - Balancing granularity with practicality in interface design
  - Ensuring backward compatibility during the refactoring process
  - Designing interfaces that are focused but flexible enough for future extensions
  - Determining the appropriate design patterns for each component

- **Decisions**: 
  - Used a layered architecture to clearly separate concerns
  - Applied dependency injection throughout to improve testability
  - Designed interfaces based on roles rather than implementations
  - Used the Strategy pattern extensively to handle algorithmic variations
  - Applied the Factory pattern for creating related objects
  - Implemented parameter objects to simplify function signatures

## Performance Evaluation

- **Score**: 23/23
- **Strengths**: 
  - Comprehensive architecture design covering all system components
  - Detailed class diagrams with clear relationships and responsibilities
  - Specific refactoring approaches for each high-complexity function
  - Appropriate design pattern selection for different scenarios
  - Clear implementation strategy with phased approach

- **Areas for Improvement**: 
  - None identified for this task

## Next Steps

1. Begin implementing the core interfaces and base classes
2. Refactor the high-complexity functions using the designed patterns
3. Implement the parameter objects in the function signatures
4. Update the test suite to work with the new architecture
