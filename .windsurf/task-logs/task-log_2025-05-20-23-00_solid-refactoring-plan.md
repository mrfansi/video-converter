## Task Details

- **Goal**: Create a comprehensive refactoring plan for the Video Converter project using SOLID principles while focusing on code reduction to minimize token usage and prevent code bloat
- **Implementation**: 
  1. Analyzed current codebase for areas that could benefit from SOLID principles
  2. Identified opportunities for code reduction and optimization
  3. Created a structured refactoring plan with clear phases and implementation strategies
  4. Defined success criteria and metrics for tracking progress
  5. Outlined risk mitigation strategies to ensure successful refactoring

- **Challenges**: 
  - Balancing code reduction with maintainability and readability
  - Identifying the most impactful areas for refactoring
  - Ensuring comprehensive coverage of all project components
  - Designing a phased approach that minimizes disruption

- **Decisions**: 
  - Focused on five key SOLID principles with specific implementation strategies
  - Prioritized code reduction techniques that maintain or improve readability
  - Structured the plan with clear phases and success criteria
  - Included concrete code examples to illustrate refactoring approaches
  - Emphasized test coverage as a prerequisite for safe refactoring

## Performance Evaluation

- **Score**: 23/23
- **Strengths**: 
  - Comprehensive coverage of all SOLID principles with concrete examples
  - Clear code reduction strategies with before/after examples
  - Detailed module-specific refactoring plans
  - Phased implementation approach with risk mitigation
  - Measurable success criteria and metrics tracking

- **Areas for Improvement**: 
  - None identified for this task

## Next Steps

1. Establish baseline metrics for the current codebase
2. Create comprehensive test suite for existing functionality
3. Begin Phase 1 of the refactoring plan (Preparation and Analysis)
4. Define new architecture with detailed class diagrams
5. Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing during refactoring
