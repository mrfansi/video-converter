**Time**: 23:15

## Overview

This document summarizes the baseline metrics for the Video Converter project before SOLID refactoring and code reduction efforts. These metrics will serve as a benchmark to measure the impact of our refactoring work.

## Codebase Size

- **Total Files**: 16 Python files
- **Total Lines**: 3,354 lines

## Code Composition

| Type | Lines | Percentage |
|------|-------|------------|
| Code | 1,899 | 56.6% |
| Docstrings | 634 | 18.9% |
| Comments | 358 | 10.7% |
| Blank Lines | 463 | 13.8% |

## Function Metrics

- **Total Functions**: 58
- **Average Function Length**: 44.7 lines
- **Average Parameters Per Function**: 3.4
- **Functions With Many Parameters (>5)**: 11 (19.0%)

## Complexity Metrics

- **Average Cyclomatic Complexity**: 4.5
- **Maximum Cyclomatic Complexity**: 29
- **Functions With High Complexity (>10)**: 6 (10.3%)

## Structure

- **Total Classes**: 15

## Key Refactoring Targets

### Functions With Many Parameters (>5)

These functions are prime candidates for parameter objects or builder pattern:

1. TBD - Will be identified from detailed metrics

### Functions With High Complexity (>10)

These functions should be refactored using strategy pattern or broken down into smaller functions:

1. TBD - Will be identified from detailed metrics

### Long Functions

The average function length of 44.7 lines indicates a need for smaller, more focused functions.

### Documentation Optimization

Nearly 19% of the codebase consists of docstrings, which could be optimized for clarity while reducing verbosity.

## Refactoring Goals

| Metric | Current | Target | Reduction |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| Total Lines | 3,354 | 2,683 | 20% |
| Average Function Length | 44.7 | 25.0 | 44% |
| Functions With Many Parameters | 11 | 0 | 100% |
| Functions With High Complexity | 6 | 0 | 100% |
| Docstring Lines | 634 | 475 | 25% |

## Conclusion

The baseline metrics reveal several opportunities for code reduction and quality improvement. By applying SOLID principles and focusing on the identified refactoring targets, we aim to achieve a 20% reduction in total code size while improving maintainability and readability.
