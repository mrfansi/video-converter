# Infrastructure Enhancement Plan: Video Converter

## Overview

This plan outlines infrastructure improvements for the Video Converter service to enhance scalability, reliability, and maintainability. The current implementation provides a solid foundation with Docker and EasyPanel support, but there are opportunities to improve the deployment architecture, monitoring, and operational aspects.

## Current Infrastructure Analysis

### Strengths

- Docker containerization for consistent deployment
- EasyPanel deployment support with Nixpacks
- Environment-based configuration with Pydantic
- Background processing with task queue
- Cloudflare R2 integration for storage
- Health check endpoint for basic monitoring

### Limitations

- Limited horizontal scaling capabilities
- No distributed task processing
- Basic monitoring without comprehensive metrics
- Limited automated testing infrastructure
- No CI/CD pipeline configuration
- No container orchestration for high availability

## Proposed Enhancements

### 1. Distributed Task Processing

**Description**: Implement a distributed task queue system for improved scalability and reliability.

**Implementation**:
- Replace in-memory task queue with Redis-backed Celery
- Implement task result storage and retrieval
- Add task prioritization and scheduling
- Implement worker scaling based on queue size
- Add dead letter queue for failed tasks

**Benefits**:
- Improved scalability with multiple worker instances
- Better reliability with persistent task storage
- Task prioritization for important conversions
- Improved error handling and retry mechanisms

**Technical Approach**:
```python
# Celery configuration
from celery import Celery

celery_app = Celery('video_converter',
                  broker='redis://redis:6379/0',
                  backend='redis://redis:6379/1')

celery_app.conf.task_routes = {
    'app.tasks.process_video': {'queue': 'video_processing'},
    'app.tasks.convert_video_format': {'queue': 'video_conversion'}
}

# Task definition
@celery_app.task(bind=True, name='app.tasks.process_video')
def process_video_task(self, temp_dir, file_path, fps, width, height, original_filename):
    # Implementation with progress updates
    self.update_state(state='PROGRESS', meta={'progress': 50, 'current_step': 'Converting frames'})
    # ...
```

spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: video-converter
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: video-converter
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: video-converter
        image: video-converter:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8000
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "512Mi"
            cpu: "500m"
          limits:
            memory: "2Gi"
            cpu: "2"
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /video-converter/health
            port: 8000
          initialDelaySeconds: 5
          periodSeconds: 10
```

### 3. Comprehensive Monitoring System

**Description**: Implement a comprehensive monitoring and alerting system.

**Implementation**:
- Add Prometheus metrics integration

- Configure alerting for critical issues
- Implement distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry

**Benefits**:
- Real-time visibility into system performance
- Early detection of issues
- Historical data for capacity planning
- Improved debugging capabilities
- Better understanding of user patterns

**Technical Approach**:
```python
# Prometheus metrics integration
from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram, start_http_server

# Define metrics
VIDEO_PROCESSING_COUNT = Counter('video_processing_total', 'Total number of videos processed', ['format', 'status'])
VIDEO_PROCESSING_DURATION = Histogram('video_processing_duration_seconds', 'Time spent processing videos', ['format'])

# In process_video_task function
def process_video_task(...):
    start_time = time.time()
    try:
        # Process video
        # ...
        VIDEO_PROCESSING_COUNT.labels(format='lottie', status='success').inc()
        VIDEO_PROCESSING_DURATION.labels(format='lottie').observe(time.time() - start_time)
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        VIDEO_PROCESSING_COUNT.labels(format='lottie', status='error').inc()
        raise
```

        "us-east": "https://us-east.r2.cloudflarestorage.com",
        "eu-west": "https://eu-west.r2.cloudflarestorage.com",
        "asia-east": "https://asia-east.r2.cloudflarestorage.com"
