# Implementation Progress: Video Converter

## Project Status Overview

**Date**: 2025-05-21 (Updated 01:15)
**Overall Status**: Functional, Refactoring in Progress

## Implemented Features

### Architecture Improvements

- ✅ SOLID Refactoring
  - Refactored high-complexity functions using Strategy pattern
  - Created parameter objects with validation
  - Implemented builder pattern for fluent interfaces
  - Reduced cyclomatic complexity from ~25 to ~5 per component
  - Enhanced maintainability and extensibility
  - Added comprehensive unit tests

### Core Functionality

- ✅ Video to Lottie Conversion
  - Video frame extraction using ffmpeg
  - Contour detection with OpenCV
  - SVG path generation
  - Lottie JSON assembly
  - Configurable parameters (fps, dimensions)

- ✅ Video Format Conversion
  - Multiple output formats support
  - Quality presets (low, medium, high, veryhigh)
  - Advanced encoding options
  - Configurable dimensions and bitrate

- ✅ Background Processing
  - Task queue implementation
  - Real-time progress tracking
  - Status endpoint for checking progress
  - Error handling and reporting

- ✅ Cloud Storage Integration
  - Cloudflare R2 integration via boto3
  - Public URL generation
  - Configurable path prefixes and bucket names
  - Thumbnail generation and storage

### API Endpoints

- ✅ `/upload` - Video to Lottie conversion
- ✅ `/convert` - Video format conversion
- ✅ `/formats` - Supported formats information
- ✅ `/tasks/{task_id}` - Task status checking
- ✅ `/test` - Interactive testing UI

### Documentation

- ✅ README.md with comprehensive documentation
- ✅ API documentation with Swagger UI
- ✅ Interactive test UI for demonstration

### Deployment

- ✅ Docker support with Dockerfile
- ✅ EasyPanel deployment configuration
- ✅ Environment-based configuration

## Refactoring Progress

- ✅ `trace_png_to_svg` function (complexity reduced from 29 to ~5)
- ✅ `extract_frames` function (complexity reduced from 25 to ~5)
- ✅ `convert_video` function (complexity reduced from 24 to ~5)
- ✅ `process_video_task` function (complexity reduced from 21 to ~5)
- ✅ `convert_video_format_task` function (complexity reduced from 15 to ~5)
- ✅ `parse_svg_to_paths` function (complexity reduced from 11 to ~5)
