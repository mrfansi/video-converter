### Project Status

The Video Converter project is a production-ready backend service for converting videos to Lottie animations and between different video formats with optimization options. The project has a well-defined architecture with some SOLID principles already implemented in the Lottie generation module, but other areas would benefit from refactoring to improve maintainability, reduce code size, and prevent bloat.

### Current Focus

Refactoring the codebase using SOLID principles while focusing on code reduction to minimize token usage and prevent code bloat. We've successfully refactored the six highest complexity functions (`trace_png_to_svg`, `extract_frames`, `convert_video`, `process_video_task`, `convert_video_format_task`, and `parse_svg_to_paths`) using the Strategy pattern, significantly reducing their cyclomatic complexity and improving maintainability. We're now focusing on creating comprehensive unit tests for the remaining refactored components, fixing lint issues, and updating the existing code to use the new implementations.

## Active Tasks

1. **SOLID Refactoring Plan Implementation**
   - Status: In Progress
   - Description: Implementing the SOLID refactoring plan to improve architecture and reduce code size
   - Progress: Created comprehensive refactoring plan, established baseline metrics, created test suites, designed parameter objects, developed detailed architecture with class diagrams, implemented core interfaces and base classes, and refactored the six highest complexity functions (`trace_png_to_svg`, `extract_frames`, `convert_video`, `process_video_task`, `convert_video_format_task`, and `parse_svg_to_paths`) using the Strategy pattern
   - Next Steps: Fix remaining lint issues and complete unit tests for all refactored components

2. **Code Reduction Analysis**
   - Status: In Progress
   - Description: Identifying areas where code can be reduced without sacrificing functionality or readability
   - Findings: Successfully reduced the complexity of `trace_png_to_svg` from 29 to ~5 per component, `extract_frames` from 25 to ~5 per component, `convert_video` from 24 to ~5 per component, `process_video_task` from 21 to ~5 per component, `convert_video_format_task` from 15 to ~5 per component, and `parse_svg_to_paths` from 11 to ~5 per component using the Strategy pattern and parameter objects
   - Next Steps: Continue implementing concrete classes using the Strategy pattern for complex algorithms and update function signatures to use parameter objects
